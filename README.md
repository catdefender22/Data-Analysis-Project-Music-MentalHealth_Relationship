## 🔍 Overview
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of a music and mental health survey dataset. The data includes responses from hundreds of people about how they listen to music, what genres they like, how many hours they listen each day, whether they compose or play instruments, alongside self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL:** For data cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying  
- **SMSS:** Used as the database engine to store and manage the relational dataset

## 📦 Dataset


  The dataset used in this project comes from the <strong> Music &amp; Mental Health Survey</strong>, a public dataset available on  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results?resource=download" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. It includes responses from individuals around the world about their music listening habits, such as favorite genres, streaming platforms, and hours spent listening alongside self-reported measures of mental health like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.


---

## 🗄️ Database

To manage and explore the dataset effectively, a relational SQL database has been created using Microsoft SQL Server. The schema is designed to reflect the natural structure of the survey, organizing responses into themes like listening habits, genre preferences, and mental health indicators.

Key relationships include:
– Each respondent providing a unique set of answers
– Music preferences connected to self-reported mental health scores
– Streaming behavior linked to demographics like age and daily listening time
– Perceived effects of music categorized alongside listening context and genre

## 🧹 Data Processing

The raw CSV file from the Kaggle dataset required some initial cleaning and preparation. 

<br><br>

- Import and load the data into SQL Server Management Studio

  The  dataset file (CSV format) was uploaded directly into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using the "Import Flat File..." wizard. This allowed me to create the table easily with its respective columns and data types, without changing the type.

- Handle missing or null values

I’m taking a look at each key table to check for any blank or NULL values. This is a quick way to spot potential data quality issues that might impact the accuracy of the analysis. For every table, I’m counting how many rows are missing important fields with the following code:


<img width="937" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dbd8837-73a0-4e45-9134-34a6e6bce9ca" />
<br><br>
Let's have a look at the result:

<img width="1310" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c4d1f94-e26a-4f2c-9ee9-2ec5db74fb81" />

Luckily, the dataset is decent, there aren’t many NULL values, so we can move forward without   cleaning.
<br><br>
  
- Simplify formats (e.g., dates)

Here the scope is to change the formats of the field date, we don't really need to know the minute and hour. Let's change it with the CAST function:

<br><br>
- Drop useless columns (e.g., "Permissions")

This is the code:
<pre>
ALTER TABLE [music-mental-health].dbo.mxmh_survey_results
DROP COLUMN Permissions;
  
</pre>

Let's double check if we truly dropped the column:

## 📈 Project Includes

- **Overview:** This analysis focuses on extracting insights around listening time, platform usage, mood effects, and mental health self-assessments. It’s not just about who listens to what but also it’s about how that might relate to how they feel.
 <br>

Are certain genres more common among people reporting anxiety?:<br>
<img width="502" height="618" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96d265a-53da-47b0-a61b-a29ff39d0b62" />

<br>

Are certain genres more common among people reporting depression?:<br>
<img width="517" height="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e939f73d-3d44-454b-9650-114a818f4769" />
<br>

Do people who listen more hours per day report different mental health patterns?:<br>
<img width="732" height="817" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1084425b-c3c6-4438-8645-4410ac0736ee" />
<br>
Not very clear, let's group using bin:
<img width="972" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22aa0ca3-ff7d-4768-94c7-f6626cfb7be5" />
Much better. From this result it seems that music is actually worsening our mental health, but it's more plausible that people dealing with more stress or emotional difficulty use music as a coping tool, resulting in longer listening times rather than music causing distress.


<br>
Self report on usefulness of music: <br>
<img width="668" height="439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8429bd1-e6c9-4a1f-a17c-b3423c23ab29" />
From a self reporting perspecting it seems that music is very helpful.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Visualization

<br>
While the foundational analysis and data preparation were done in SQL, the remaining exploration particularly around customer behavior, delivery patterns, and geographical trends will be completed in Tableau. This decision was made to leverage Tableau's interactive and visual capabilities, making the insights easier to interpret and communicate to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The dashboard will consolidate key KPIs and allow users to explore the data through filters, maps, and dynamic charts.

Here the result:<br> <br>
