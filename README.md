## üîç Overview
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of a music and mental health survey dataset. The data includes responses from hundreds of people about how they listen to music, what genres they like, how many hours they listen each day, whether they compose or play instruments, alongside self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **SQL:** For data cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying  
- **SMSS:** Used as the database engine to store and manage the relational dataset

## üì¶ Dataset


  The dataset used in this project comes from the <strong> Music &amp; Mental Health Survey</strong>, a public dataset available on  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results?resource=download" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. It includes responses from individuals around the world about their music listening habits, such as favorite genres, streaming platforms, and hours spent listening alongside self-reported measures of mental health like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.


---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

To manage and explore the dataset effectively, a relational SQL database has been created using Microsoft SQL Server. The schema is designed to reflect the natural structure of the survey, organizing responses into themes like listening habits, genre preferences, and mental health indicators.

Key relationships include:
‚Äì Each respondent providing a unique set of answers
‚Äì Music preferences connected to self-reported mental health scores
‚Äì Streaming behavior linked to demographics like age and daily listening time
‚Äì Perceived effects of music categorized alongside listening context and genre

 ## Schema structure

## üßπ Data Processing

The raw CSV files from the Kaggle dataset required some initial cleaning and preparation. SQL scripts were written to:




- Import and load the data into SQL Server Management Studio

  The raw dataset files (CSV format) were uploaded directly into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using the "Import Flat File..." wizard. This allowed me to create all tables easily with their respective columns and data types, without (mostly) changing the type.



<img width="825" height="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8dd8fd6-91d2-4500-ac07-cb98c58cc20e" />

- Handle missing or null values

I‚Äôm checking for blank and NULL values across all key tables in the Olist dataset. This helps identify any data quality issues that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. For each table, I count how many rows are missing critical fields like IDs, timestamps, payment values, or location data.

Example:

<pre> 
 
 SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_order_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_item_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_order_item_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_product_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN seller_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_seller_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN shipping_limit_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_shipping_limit_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN price IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_price,
    SUM(CASE WHEN freight_value IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_freight_value
FROM olist_order_items_dataset;
 
  </pre>

I then run the equivalent code for each table, confirming the number of rows containing NULL values and excluding them.

  
- Normalize formats (e.g., dates)

Here the scope is to check the formats of key fields such as dates or costs. If in a wrong format change that.  

Example:

<img width="1381" height="133" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9358cc4-165b-4eb8-baa0-cd76b8bb93b4" />


Here we change the date using the CAST function, we are not going to do an analysis that requires the precise moment.


<pre> 
 
 ALTER TABLE olist_orders_dataset
ALTER COLUMN order_purchase_timestamp DATE;

ALTER TABLE olist_orders_dataset
ALTER COLUMN order_approved_at DATE;

ALTER TABLE olist_orders_dataset
ALTER COLUMN order_delivered_carrier_date DATE;

ALTER TABLE olist_orders_dataset
ALTER COLUMN order_delivered_customer_date DATE;

ALTER TABLE olist_orders_dataset
ALTER COLUMN order_estimated_delivery_date DATE;

 
 </pre>

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Visualization

<br>
While the foundational analysis and data preparation were done in SQL, the remaining exploration particularly around customer behavior, delivery patterns, and geographical trends will be completed in Tableau. This decision was made to leverage Tableau's interactive and visual capabilities, making the insights easier to interpret and communicate to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The dashboard will consolidate key KPIs and allow users to explore the data through filters, maps, and dynamic charts.

Here the result:<br> <br>
